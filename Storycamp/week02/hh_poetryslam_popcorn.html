    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity. See all Hands on Hacking Hacktivities at-->
    <h3>Hands on Hacking</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>Learners create a video Haiku around the development of a mass media and hold a Twitter based poetry slam.<br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li> <img src="../static/ib_popcorn/step03_writetheRules.png" alt="compose a poem" width="155" height="118">
      <p>Have learners compose a poem about some part of media history. Choose an event that surrounds the development one of the mass mediums. For example, what changed in society when the printing press was invented? The phonograph? Cinema? Radio? The web?</p>
      </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Introduce the design challenge:</h5> <a href="../../Storycamp2.0/week02/soundcloud.com"><img src="https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1690665610/big_avatar.png" width="124" class="right two"></a><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net"><img src="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/images/Audacity-logo-r_50pct.jpg" width="124px" class="right"></a>
      <p>Design Challenge: How does imagery influence the way someone hears or reads a piece of text? Now that you've written a poem about an aspect of mass media, you'll find web content and images to illustrate your point. Record your poem and upload the audio file to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/upload">Soundcloud</a>. If you need a software to record and edit audio files, try <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. If you need help using Audacity, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=record+with+audacity&oq=record+with+audacity&gs_l=youtube-reduced.3..0j0i5l3.230.2715.0.2843.20.12.0.0.0.0.362.1806.4j1j4j1.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.ub6C-AI_eWo">YouTube has lots of videos on the subject</a>.</p>
      <p>Allow learners to create a plan for their videos using pens and paper. What assets will they collect? What images will they use? Invite them to draw sketches and plans of their videos.</p>
    </li>
    <li><img src="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/thumbnail-stopandfrisk.png" alt="stopandfrisk" width="120">
      <p>Have learners remix the <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/templates/basic/?savedDataUrl=projects/stop-and-frisk.json">Radio Rookies Stop and Frisk project</a> using Popcorn Maker to put their poems and assets together. Learners should swap the Media Source out with their uploaded Soundcloud files. Tell them to use events to illustrate their ideas on their topics. They should also establish a Twitter hashtag and include it in their videos so that people can vote for their poems.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"> <img src="../static/hh_popcorn/step04_remixathonCultural.png" alt="step04_remixathonCultural" width="162" height="137" class="right">
      <p>Presentation and peer review. Everyone should use the hashtags to vote for their favorite video, and have voters include #popcornpoem, so that the rest of the world can see the Poetry Slam too!</p>
