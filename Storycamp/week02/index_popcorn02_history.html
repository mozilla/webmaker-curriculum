  <h3>Big Picture</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      
      <!--What skills will your participants LEARN?* -->
      <h5>Participants will understand that:</h5>
      <ul class="inner">
        <li>Media has influence over culture and society, and cultures and societies have influence over shaping media.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Learners will be able to :</h5>
      <ul class="inner">
        <li>Use Popcorn Maker to pull dynamic data from the web into a video.</li>
        <li>Recontextualize a story by adding data and unique voice to it.</li>
        <li>Discuss media's implications on society and culture</li>
        <li>Create storyboards and schematics.</li>
      </ul>
      <!--Add your own! This kit can be hacked to include interest driven content. For example, you might add a skill like "Learners will be able to recognize different endangered animals."--> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>The Results:</h4>
      <!--what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Pick your tools: what Mozilla tool fits your audience, big picture and results best?-->
      <ul class="inner">
        <li> Learners will use <a href="http://popcorn.webmaker.org">Popcorn Maker</a> to make a new project. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
     <li>
      <h4>Tell the story:</h4>
      <!--what is the snapshot that gives your students an overview of what they will do for the day? -->
      <p>Learners will make their own web native films and explore larger concepts on the topic. They will collaborate to make critical commentary and use assets from the web to tell a story of their own.</p>
      <!-- Add your own...In my (fun title) event, my students will LEARN (skills) by MAKING (project)--> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Circle Up Module</h4>
      <!--After a day of hacking it’s important to review what was learned. Designate guiding questions that help facilitators activate essential questions in their own learners. Activate Essential Questions that lead to deep understanding: what do you want your learners to be able to discuss and reflect upon? -->
      <ul class="inner">
        <li>How does media influence society?</li>
        <li>How is the web different from the other mass mediums?</li>

  <h3>Hacktivities</h3>
  <!--Next, you'll make a list of plug n' play activities, we call them "Hacktivities". Come up with at least one activity for each type. In the end, you'll have an Icebreaker Activity, a Diving In Activity and a Hands On Hacking activity.-->
  <ol>
    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <li class="inner">
      <h4>Icebreaker</h4>

    <!--A diving in activity is one that gives pointed instruction to participants on tools or procedures. An example of a diving in activity would be allowing the participants to get used to the interface of Thimble or Popcorn by having them make projects. Before learners can practically apply new skills, they need to be comfortable with the tools they'll be using and have a basic understanding of the skills they'll be sharpening. -->
    <li class="inner">
      <h4>Diving In</h4>

    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity.-->
    <li class="inner">
      <h4>Hands on Hacking</h4>

    <li>
      <h4>Playtesting and Feedback</h4>
      <!--Your learners made  something, now it’s time to have them Playtest their   ideas so that they  can iterate and improve their projects. This module helps facilitators create review criteria.-->
      <h5>Learners share their projects. <!--Ask them to observe the review criteria that you set. Example criteria might be: --> 
        <br/>
        Is the user:</h5>
      <ul class="inner">
        <li> following the instructions?</li>
        <li> getting the joke?</li>
        <li> understanding the commentary?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <!--Add your own criteria.-->
      
      <h5>Have learners form groups and take notes.</h5>
      <h5>Start a discussion by having learners complete sentences.</h5>
      <!--Some sentences might be:-->
      <ul class="inner">
        <li> I thought you did a nice job with/of ___.</li>
        <li> You might want to improve ___.</li>
        <li> Your idea was fun/interesting because ___.</li>
        <li> What you made was ___ and it made me think/feel ____.</li>
        
        <!-- Add your own sentences.-->
      </ul>
      <h5>Let your learners review each other's work. </h5>
      <p>When they're finished with their reviews, ask them what next steps would be   for each project. How can each project be iterated and improved upon?</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h4>Assessment</h4>
      <!--You'll want to let people using your Hacktivity Kit know how to assess the learning at their event. Create a correlation between badges and learning objectives. Then, write down a rubric for people to follow. Use  this sheet to help you create your assessment grids and rubrics.-->
