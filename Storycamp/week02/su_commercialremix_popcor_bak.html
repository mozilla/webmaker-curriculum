    <!--A diving in activity is one that gives pointed instruction to participants on tools or procedures. An example of a diving in activity would be allowing the participants to get used to the interface of Thimble or Popcorn by having them make projects. Before learners can practically apply new skills, they need to be comfortable with the tools they'll be using and have a basic understanding of the skills they'll be sharpening. -->
    <h3>Diving In</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>The goal of this hacktivity is for participants to add their own voice to an old commercial by adding pop ups and commentary.<br/>

    <li><img src="../static/su_popcorn/step01_openPopcornGetStarted.png" alt="step01_openPopcorn" width="165" height="142">
      <p>Visit the Make a Popup Video project <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/projects/make-pop-video/">here</a>. Tell participants that they will be hacking a commercial by adding popups that change the meaning of the commercial. On the Project page, click the <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/templates/basic/?savedDataUrl=/api/remix/1067">"Get Started"</a> button.</p>

    <li class="right"><img src="../static/su_popcorn/step02_groupPopcorn.png" alt="step02_groupPopcorn" width="121" height="136" class="right">
      <p>Allow learners to work individually or together. Have learners find a commercial they would like to comment on at <a href="http://archive.org/details/prelinger_commercials" target="_blank">Prelinger Archives</a>. Browse by collection or title. Once learners have found a commercial to work with, have them choose a file type (we recommend the ogg file format) and click to open the commercial in the browser.</p>

      <p>Learners should start by replacing the Media Source URL. Float around to help learners that get stuck. </p>

    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    <p>Have participants talk about their films. Ask them what they had to do to make a story of their own. Reinforce the idea that Popcorn allows them to pull in dynamic data. Ask learners what the difference between a traditional film and a web native film is.</p><p>
Following  the presentations, facilitators should direct participants to other resources in their community or online to learn more about storytelling, user participation and interactivity. Provide individual constructive feedback during presentations.</p>  </div>
