    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
    <!--Give 2 to 3 sentences about what the Hacktivity is and what learners will do.-->
    <p>This activity is a hack of the game musical chairs. Thematic statements are introduced and learners for whom the statement is true, must find a new seat.<br/>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><img src="static/ib_thimble/step01_strongwind_thimble.png" alt="step01_strongwind_thimble"> <p>To set up the game, get all participants sitting in a circle with no  empty chairs. The facilitator, who is standing and has no chair, is the  first to "play". Tell Learners that the topic is the Web. The facilitator makes the first statement, for example:</p>
<ul><li><em>"A Strong wind blows for anyone who knows HTML syntax"</em> 
</li><li>
    <em>"A Strong wind blows for anyone who knows what CSS stands for"</em> 
</li><li>
    <em>"A Strong wind blows for anyone who thinks Wikipedia is always true"</em>
</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li class="right"> <img src="static/ib_thimble/step02_strongwind_thimble.png" alt="step02_strongwind_thimble" class="right">
      <p>As soon as the statement has been made, every person for whom the  statement is true must jump out of their seat and find a new available  seat. The person who made the statement is almost always able to grab a  seat, which leaves a new person standing once all seats are filled. That  person must then make a "strong wind blows" statement to continue  the game. </p>
    </li>
    <li><img src="static/ib_thimble/step03_strongwind_thimble.png" alt="step03_strongwind_thimble">      <p>An additional rule is provided for amusement and chaos, as well as for  anyone unable to fashion a"strong wind" statement: the person standing may yell "Hurricane!", which compels all participants to  scramble for a new seat. </p>
    </li>
    <li class="right"> <p>When the session facilitator is ready to bring the game to a close (after perhaps 5 or 10 minutes), they simply stand and refrain from grabbing a seat when other participants are changing positions. </p>
    </li>

    <h1>Discussion</h1>
   <p>Help clarify topics that didn't a lot of learners moving from their seats. Ask the learners questions that help them reflect on themes in the statements made. For example:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>
Who can put content on the Web?</li><li>
Who owns the Web?</li><li>
What does HTML actually do?</li><li>
What does HTML syntax look like?</li><li>
Why is it better to question the truth of something rather than take it at face value? </li>
   </ul>
