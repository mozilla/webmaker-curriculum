  <h3>Big Picture</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      
      <!--What skills will your participants LEARN?* -->
      <h5>Participants will understand that:</h5>
      <ul class="inner">
        <li>Information architecture is a system of  organization that takes into account both how you present information and how a user accesses that information. </li>
        <li><a href="http://hivenyc.org/CrashCourses/svt.html">SVT (Story, Vision, Tech)</a> is a solid model for creating a web native film and other web native stories. Technology can serve as inspiration, but never substitute for a story.</li>
        <li>Procedural storytelling refers to a way of designing stories so they’re different every time. It is just one of the unique aspects of Web Native Film.</li>
        <li>the open structure of the Web allows you to create procedural stories</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Learners will be able to :</h5>
      <ul class="inner">
        <li>Use Popcorn Maker to pull dynamic data from the web into a video.</li>
        <li>Use keyboard shortcuts (i.e. for copying and pasting)</li>
        <li>Right-click and scroll with the mouse</li>
      </ul>
      <!--Add your own! This kit can be hacked to include interest driven content. For example, you might add a skill like "Learners will be able to recognize different endangered animals."--> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>The Results:</h4>
      <!--what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Pick your tools: what Mozilla tool fits your audience, big picture and results best?-->
      <ul class="inner">
        <li> Learners will use <a href="http://popcorn.webmaker.org">Popcorn Maker</a> to make a new project. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <h4>Tell the story:</h4>
      <!--what is the snapshot that gives your students an overview of what they will do for the day? -->
      <p>Learners will make their own web native films and explore larger concepts on the topic. They will begin using the Popcorn Maker interface.</p>
      <!-- Add your own...In my (fun title) event, my students will LEARN (skills) by MAKING (project)--> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Circle Up Module</h4>
      <!--After a day of hacking it’s important to review what was learned. Designate guiding questions that help facilitators activate essential questions in their own learners. Activate Essential Questions that lead to deep understanding: what do you want your learners to be able to discuss and reflect upon? -->
      <ul class="inner">
        <li>What does information architecture mean?</li>
        <li>What does "open web" mean?</li>
        <li>What is procedural storytelling?</li>
        <li>How did feedback help you iterate and improve your project?</li>

  <h3>Hacktivities</h3>
  <!--Next, you'll make a list of plug n' play activities, we call them "Hacktivities". Come up with at least one activity for each type. In the end, you'll have an Icebreaker Activity, a Diving In Activity and a Hands On Hacking activity.-->
  <ol>
    <!--An icebreaker is an activity that gets the blood pumping, forms connections between learners, and introduces a topic. There are thousands of different ways to introduce a topic and get learners interacting with each other. Choose one and hack it to be your own! -->
    <li class="inner">
      <h4>Icebreaker</h4>

       <img src="http://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/storycamp/static/ib_popcorn/step04_spectrogram.png" alt="Spectrogram"></a></li>
    <!--A diving in activity is one that gives pointed instruction to participants on tools or procedures. An example of a diving in activity would be allowing the participants to get used to the interface of Thimble or Popcorn by having them make projects. Before learners can practically apply new skills, they need to be comfortable with the tools they'll be using and have a basic understanding of the skills they'll be sharpening. -->
    <li class="inner">
      <h4>Diving In</h4>

      </li>
    <!--A Hands on Hacking activity is a practical activity that allows learners to delve deeper into the essential questions of your session. Go back to thinking of the results: what will your learners MAKE when they are done? Create a project that gives learners enough time to explore and tinker while working towards the completion of the activity.-->
    <li class="inner">
      <h4>Hands on Hacking</h4>

    <li>
      <h4>Playtesting and Feedback</h4>
      <!--Your learners made  something, now it’s time to have them Playtest their   ideas so that they  can iterate and improve their projects. This module helps facilitators create review criteria.-->
      <h5>Learners share their projects. <!--Ask them to observe the review criteria that you set. Example criteria might be: --> 
        <br/>
        Is the user:</h5>
      <ul class="inner">
        <li> following the instructions?</li>
        <li> getting the joke?</li>
        <li> understanding the commentary?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <!--Add your own criteria.-->
      
      <h5>Have learners form groups and take notes.</h5>
      <h5>Start a discussion by having learners complete sentences.</h5>
      <!--Some sentences might be:-->
      <ul class="inner">
        <li> I thought you did a nice job with/of ___.</li>
        <li> You might want to improve ___.</li>
        <li> Your idea was fun/interesting because ___.</li>
        <li> What you made was ___ and it made me think/feel ____.</li>
        
        <!-- Add your own sentences.-->
      </ul>
      <h5>Let your learners review each other's work. </h5>
      <p>When they're finished with their reviews, ask them what next steps would be   for each project. How can each project be iterated and improved upon?</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h4>Assessment</h4>
      <!--You'll want to let people using your Hacktivity Kit know how to assess the learning at their event. Create a correlation between badges and learning objectives. Then, write down a rubric for people to follow. Use  this sheet to help you create your assessment grids and rubrics.-->
