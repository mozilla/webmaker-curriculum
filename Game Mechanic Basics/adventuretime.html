        <h1>Steps for this Activity</h1>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>Before we embark on what we promise you to be an extraordinary adventure, errr... let's actually create the story behind it. <strong>Equip yourself with post-its and markers and think of characters and situations in your life, and start writing a few paragraphs about them.</strong> You may be writing about yourself, relatives, friends, your favorite hobby, or what you had for breakfast. Spend at least 30 minutes writing and doodling quirks and notes about these characters. Don't take a break just keep doodling and scribbling.</li>
            <li> <strong>You probably have a ton of characters by now, choose one or two that you really like and give them a goal.</strong> It can be a material goal like collect all the magical items or a philosophical one like find true love.</li>
            <li> No game is fun without some challenge. <strong>Come up with some obstacles</strong> that will get in the way of your characters. </li>
            <li>Good stories, have their audience wondering what will happen next. To create that feeling, <strong>add twists in your plot and think of how your character transforms</strong> on his journey to reach the goal.</li>
            <li> If you have played a <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">Choose your own Adventure</a> before you know that this kind of game is all about giving your player choices. But beware â€“ if you give your player too many choices in each scene, your story will turn into a gordian knot. </li>
            <li>Now that you have everything ready, <strong>draw it out! Use post-its to create a map of your game.</strong> Playtest a version with your friends by narrating your story and asking them to take choices. Were the choices interesting enough? Did your game include surprises? </li>
            <li>Once you have tested your paper-prototype to see what works and what doesn't, <a href="#">use this activity to make a digital version with Javascript</a>, and you'll learn a little bit about conditionals, functions and console.log along the way.</li>
          </ol>
