        <ol>
          <li><img src="https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/GameMakery/images/InTheWild-1.png" width="100px"><strong>Choose your favorite videogame.</strong> We know it's hard to just pick one, but choose an established game that you love.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
            <li><img src="https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/GameMakery/images/InTheWild-02.png" width="100px"> Find a large piece of paper and get equipped with lots of sticky notes and markers. Ready for some art? <strong>Sketch out your games main components; heroes, villains, monsters, gold blocks, special weapons â€“ include them all and write next to each component a few of its key attributes.</strong> For example, "this main hero jumps and shoots", "this special weapon throws glitter" and so on.</li>
            <li><img src="https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/GameMakery/images/InTheWild-03.png" width="100px"> <strong>Now draw the space of your game.</strong> Don't worry about the details, it can be a map of the game or the space from one of your favorite game levels. Feeling ambitious? Add some of the space attributes;  what is the texture like, the lighting, are there obstacles? </li>
            <li><img src="https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/GameMakery/images/InTheWild-04.png" width="100px">Time to include your games' goals in your mega-sketch. This should be fairly easy, <strong>try to think of how you win the game.</strong> Do you have to unlock all the puzzles, save the castle, beat the villain?</li>
            <li><img src="https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/GameMakery/images/InTheWild-05.png" width="100px"> Time for some action! <strong>Write down the main mechanics for your game</strong>, you can draw them too. Consider mechanics as the main actions you take in the game. Think of verbs like jumping, collecting and negotiating. </li>
            <li><img src="https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/GameMakery/images/InTheWild-06.png" width="100px">The last component you should draw or write down is the challenge that leads you to make choices in the game. <strong>Challenge and choice make us want to keep trying to complete the goal.</strong> For example, one of the challenges in SimCity is to grow your city while keeping your population happy, in Portal 2 CoOp one of the challenges is to work together with your coplayer to solve spatial puzzles. </li>

        <div><strong>Break it down:</strong> Can you name your games systems? What are the components, space, challenge, mechanics, goals and choices?
          <p><strong>What is a game? What is not a game?</strong> Now that you have all your pieces, take a step back and circle back with the rest of the people in your game jam. Discuss what you think makes a game? Share what everybody made and consider what would happen if you took one element of a game system out, how would the game experience change and why?</p>
