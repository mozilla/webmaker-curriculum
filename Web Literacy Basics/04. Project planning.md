Module 4: Project Planning (3 units)
====================================

In this module learners plan a project by thinking about who they want to communicate with, how they will organize what they want to say and how they envision the project with paper prototyping. At the end of this module, learners will have a paper prototype of their dream web project. 


##Learning Objectives and Assessment

By the end of this module, learners should be able to: 

* identify the different parts of a Web page using industry-recognized terms 
* start improving the accessibility of a Web page by modifying its color scheme and markup
* consider their audience and think critically about the way they structure content

Learners should also be aware that:

* 'Information Architecture' is a system of organization that takes into account both how you present information and how a user accesses that information
* working openly means you release early and often to improve your own practice
* webmaking intermingles social skills, technical skills and topical knowledge
* being part of a community means you can improve your practice and help improve others' as well
* inviting people into your work is a good way to give them agency to contribute
