            <blockquote>
              <p>“[O]ur world changed in April 1993 when the Mosaic 1.0 browser was released to the general public. We need new forms of education. We need to reform our learning institutions, concepts, and modes of assessment for our age. Now, anyone with access to the World Wide Web can go far beyond the passive consumer model to contribute content on the Web. We can customize and remix, alone or in collaboration with others, located anywhere on the Web. That Do-It-Yourself potential for connected, participatory, improvisational learning requires new skills, what many are calling new “literacies”.”</p>
              <cite> – Davidson, 2012</cite>
            </blockquote>
              
                  Members of the Learning Network team as well as Mark Surman and a consultant from Organizing for Action <b>met in Brooklyn from Feb. 9 - 12</b> to further develop the clubs program. We finalized details of how to build and roll out the program, and how it will be successful.<br
    /><br
    />Specifically, we left with <b>an actionable workplan</b> for how we launch clubs.<br
    /><br
    />This action plan is supported by:<br
    /><br
    /><ul><li><b>A calendar </b>that specifies what we will offer and by when.</li
    ><li><b>A detailed list</b> of what's in the clubs package and a path to curating, testing and&nbsp; spreading it: curriculum, online platform, leadership activation, marketing materials.</li
    ><li><b>A pipeline</b> of clubs we want to bring on-board this year and by when.</li
    ><li><b>Hypotheses</b> we want to test as we roll out clubs.<br/><br
    /></li></ul
    >Below is a summary of the key decisions we made.&nbsp;<br
    /><br
    /><b>I. FRAMING</b><br
    /><br
    /><ul><li><b>1. Insights from other organizations.</b> We interviewed and analyzed other successful organizing model, from Code Club to Free the Children to Organizing for Action. These are the best practices we want to apply to clubs:&nbsp;<ul><li><b>Strong, personal on-boarding. </b>This process should be well scripted, available online, and as much as possible, conducted in-person by volunteers.</li
    ><li><b>Overt, explicit and clear pathways. </b>A contributor's development path in the organization should be widely understood, clearly communicated and compelling for them to pursue it.</li
    ><li><b>Website that facilitates connections among mentors. </b>There should be a website that serves as a hub and watering hole for the community. Different levels of volunteers should be able to communicate with one another, share resources, and organize themselves. Strong social media presence is a must.</li
    ><li><b>Support personal development and professional growth. </b>Make clear value propositions, such as training, so community members self-actualize and gain professional experience.</li
    ><li><b>Permeate a sense of belonging and narrative. </b>There needs to be a Story of Self &gt; Us &gt; Now that is widely understood, oft repeated and made personal by community members. This narrative is bolster by a strong sense of belonging.</li
    ><li><b>Offer embeddable as well as standalone programming. </b>When existing structures are in place, i.e. via a partner network, offer embeddable activities and support. When individual community members seek structure, offer them guidance on how to build their own.&nbsp;</li
    ><li><b>Teach local, share global in organized peaks and valleys. </b>Empower community members to make a difference locally &amp; develop local action plans. These should be connected to global campaigns and moments. Organizing requires peaks and valleys, which should be clearly communicated, well planned and celebratory upon completion.&nbsp;<br/><br
    /></li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>2. Understanding our allies.</b> We discussed and prioritized our top two club leader personas. These are based on deep relationship with collaborators and an analysis of who would most benefit from and be activated by the clubs program. These are the main personas we' we're serving, with a refined understanding of their motivations, their needs and concerns.<br/><br
    /><ul><li><b>Activist:</b><ul><li><i>Motivation:</i> Cares about the web, issues like privacy. Loves Snowden.&nbsp;</li
    ><li><i>Needs</i>: Help on how to teach. Seeks collaborators and a community.&nbsp;</li
    ><li><i>Incentives</i>: Belonging, impact, recognition.</li
    ><li><i>Concerns</i>: Feeling under appreciated, mixed to low teaching skills</li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>Educator:</b><ul><li><i>Motivation:</i> Just wants good content for their learners</li
    ><li><i>Needs</i>: Curriculum &amp; web tools, professional development, access to skilled educators</li
    ><li><i>Incentives</i>: Engaged learners, professional develop credentials</li
    ><li><i>Concerns</i>: Not drawn primarily by cause, narrative or brand.<br/><br
    /></li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>The Grid:&nbsp;</b></li></ul
    ></li></ul
    >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^&nbsp; mission<br
    />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br
    />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br
    />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;--------------------------------------&gt;&nbsp;<br
    />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; structure<br
    />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br
    />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br
    /><br
    /><ul><li><b>3. Our values and Point-of-View. </b>We decided on the values that clubs embody. We established the social practices we want to embed and repeat in the program. These values inform our point-of-view (POV) in our curriculum, leadership development and online tools. Our POV is compelling to our two personas and differentiates us.&nbsp;<br/><br
    /><ul><li><b>Why we teach: </b><i>This is our mission</i>.<ul><li>We are dedicated to empowering others with web literacy so that they have agency on the web as creators, citizens and future leaders.&nbsp;</li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>How we teach: </b><i>This is our pedagogy.&nbsp;</i><ul><li>Teaching and learning is how we achieve our mission. They are political as well as self-actualizing acts. We teach and learn by making projects together and openly reflecting on the process in an inclusive and locally relevant environment. Learning is social, production-centered, and open-ended. It is done best when facilitated in small groups meeting in-person.</li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>Who we teach:</b> <i>This is our audience.&nbsp;</i><ul><li>We teach our peers, so that we can reflect and improve together. We teach our local community, so we can give back and make a different locally.&nbsp;</li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>What we teach:</b> <i>This is our subject.</i>&nbsp;<ul><li>We teach web literacy, which encompasses the mechanics, culture and citizenship of the web. Our learners are more self-actualized as creators when they can use the web as a platform for creativity. They are better citizens when they can make more informed choices on the web. And they are economically more empowered with skills and practical knowledge of this public resources.&nbsp;</li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>Where we teach:</b> <i>This is our classroom.</i><ul><li>We teach locally, wherever we have our learners, be that in formal classrooms, to libraries and coffee shops and kitchen tables. We learn globally, as we connect with peers who inspire and mentor us to make local change that has a global impact.<br/><br
    /></li></ul
    ></li></ul
    ></li></ul
    ><b>II. SUCCESS IS...</b><br
    /><br
    /><ul><li><b>1. Metrics. </b>We decided what it means to "be active in a city" for Mozilla Learning Networks in 2015. Our goal this year is 500 cities. A city has to fulfill one of the following to count:<ul><li>3 volunteer job descriptions filled and reporting on local activity</li
    ><li>1 event per quarter done by the same leader(s) (or pledged)<br/><br
    /></li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>2. Naming. </b>We also discussed what to name this initiative and larger branding implications. Our conclusion: "Mozilla Academy"<ul><li><b>Focus on "Mozilla" as the uniting brand.</b> This is preferred over "Webmaker", "Hive" or other secondary brand. "Moz" can continue as suffix.&nbsp;</li
    ><li><b>Test out "Academy" </b>or similar name instead of "clubs." This clearly communicates learning, some structure, but also expandability. You can have one local Mozilla Academy, as well as a global online Mozilla Academy of all the mentors.&nbsp;</li
    ><li><b>Continue using generic suffix</b>, i.e. " __ Party", "__ Festival", "__ Learning Network" as the generic part of the Mozilla branding equation.&nbsp;<br/><br
    /></li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>3. Organizing model. </b>To be successful, we need tiers of organizing. These were deeply informed by our affiliate comparison work and leveraging existing tiers. We anticipate needing three job roles, at least. The job descriptions are here: <a href="https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/clubroles">https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/clubroles</a><ul><li>Club Leader</li
    ><li>Regional Coordinator</li
    ><li>Organizer<br/><br
    /></li></ul
    ></li></ul
    ><b>III. Program Offering</b><br
    /><br
    /><ul><li><b>1. Leadership Development. </b>We defined what leadership skills we want to foster in our community, the job descriptions that support and encourage their development, and the offering we provide to help them develop as leaders. This is what we agreed on needing, with tiers of access: Anyone [grab &amp; go for all resources], Club Leaders [grab &amp; go AND club-specific resources], Regional Coordinator [all the above AND regional coordinator training]<ul><li><i>Job descriptions </i>with clear expectations for each leadership role.</li
    ><li><i>On-boarding</i> that is personal and covers messaging, personally owning The Story of Self.</li
    ><li><i>Professional development&nbsp;</i><ul><li>how to teach</li
    ><li>how to be a good facilitator</li
    ><li>how to foster an inclusive, open culture</li
    ><li>how to be a good project manager</li
    ><li>how to adapt curriculum to your learners</li
    ><li>how to do community outreach</li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><i>Modeling</i><ul><li>Pattern of 1:1 meetings, club evaluations, testing.</li
    ><li>Participating in forums and modeling best practices</li
    ><li>Documenting exemplary club activity</li
    ><li>Recognizing and celebrating learners and mentors</li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><i>Partnering and local action planning</i><ul><li>Make strategic local plans</li
    ><li>On-board and work with local partners</li
    ><li>Reflect and iterate on local plans<br/><br
    /></li></ul
    ></li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>2. Online Platform. </b>We scoped requirements and prioritized the phases of development. These tickets describe the features in scope for v1.0, aimed for release at the end of Q!: <a href="https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Mozilla-Learning/labels/v1">https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Mozilla-Learning/labels/v1</a>. The top-level summary of the v1.0 site is:&nbsp;<ul><li>Showcase resources for teaching and organizing</li
    ><li>Connect mentors to one another</li
    ><li>Show clubs on a map<br/><br
    /></li></ul
    ></li
    ><li><b>3. Curriculum. </b>We identified the two streams of curriculum we want to create and a path to packaging and testing it.&nbsp;<ul><li>We concluded we want top-line curriculum partners for each module, including MDN, IMLS, Rio LAN Houses and Aspiration. Each module will have a final project with a light "give it forward" ask to go out and teach the module to someone else.&nbsp;</li
    ><li>Curriculum will be mobile-optimized and where possible, point to the Webmaker tool but not exclusively. It will include learning outcomes and questionnaires, as well as templates for featured remixes.&nbsp;</li
    ><li>This first quarter will focus on getting the module architecture right. Then in Q2 we'll work on distributed "barnraising" to populate later modules including writing out roles and incentives.&nbsp;</li
    ><li>See the curriculum queue: <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/">http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/</a><ul><li><i>Web Literacy</i>: learners are end-users</li
    ><li><i>Teach like Mozilla</i>: mentors are the end-users<br/><br

            <p>Founded in 1998, Mozilla is a global community of technologists, teachers and makers working together to keep the Internet<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> open, accessible and editable. We collaborate on a global basis to ensure everyone can be informed contributors and creators of the web. This act of human collaboration across an open platform we believe to be essential to individual growth and our collective future.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
            <p>Mozilla helps people develop web literacy: we help them build, not just consume, the technology, media and information that makes up the web. Whether through the thousands of volunteers who write code for Firefox or the growing community that is designing courses for teaching the web, Mozilla strives for an Internet that is:</p>

                </div>

            </div>

            <ul class="visible-xs">
              <li><strong>Knowable:</strong> it’s transparent – we can see it and understand it</li>
              <li><strong>Interoperable:</strong> it presents opportunity to play and innovate</li>
              <li><strong>Ours:</strong> it’s open to everyone and we define it</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The development of Mozilla products relies upon community involvement and contribution. We are part of a broader alliance of organizations including, for example, foundations like the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.macfound.org/">MacArthur Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.sloan.org/">Sloan Foundation</a>, and <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">Knight Foundation</a>. In addition, we work with <a href="http://hivelearningnetwork.org/">Hive Learning Network</a> members such as libraries, museums, and non-profits. Mozilla also works on a number of levels to keep the web as an open platform for innovation.</p>

            <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
            <p>Since the mid-1990s more and more products, services and scenes from everyday life have moved online. This has led to many benefits, such as personal and business interactions being augmented and improved web-based communication. However, the Open Web that Mozilla believes in so strongly is now under attack from a variety of forces.</p>
            <p>One of these forces is the tendency of commercial providers towards <em>silos</em>. In contrast, Mozilla believes that <strong>the web is the platform</strong>. By this we mean that, through adherence to open standards and protocols, people and organizations can work together to interact, exchange and trade using a shared platform. Closed, proprietary platforms are silos that limit user choice.</p>

            <div class="well" id="silos">
              <h3>How Mozilla fights silos</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>On the web browser level through <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox">Firefox</a>. Users now have a choice between major web browsers - all compatible with open standards.</li>
                <li>On the mobile operating system level with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">FirefoxOS</a>. Instead of closed ‘app stores’, users can download and create web apps from anywhere on the web.</li>
                <li>On the wider ecosystem level by developing new, open technologies and protocols that are then used by other providers. Examples of this include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a>.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Another force attacking the Open Web is that of <em>elegant consumption</em>. Well-designed interfaces that delight and surprise us are to be encouraged, but when they are locked down, when there is no way to ‘view source’, then we become trapped as mere consumers of other people’s content. This has repercussions not only for accessibility and localization, but for our very freedom on the web.</p>
            <p>Many people use the web comfortably and intuitively on a daily basis for both work and leisure. Doing so, nevertheless, requires an understanding of how to both read and edit the web. Just as with traditional literacy, this ‘web literacy’ is something that people can get better at over time. The problem is that there has never been consensus around what constitutes ‘web literacy’. Just what is it that people should be getting better at to avoid being stuck in the trap of elegant consumption?</p>

            <h2 id="web-literacy">Web Literacy</h2>
            <p>Mozilla understands web literacy to be the skills and competencies required to read, write and participate effectively on the web. One of the problems with attempting to teach and learn web literacy has been the lack of an agreed ‘map of the territory’ from which to build resources and curricula. Other candidate terms such as ‘digital literacy’ and ‘information literacy’ seem too wide-ranging and ambiguous to adequately cover the web.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> Possible alternatives such as ‘media literacy’ and ‘computational thinking’ certainly <em>overlap</em> with web literacy, but there is something sufficiently unique about ‘web literacy’ to be worth of attention.</p>
            <p>There have been recent arguments within the world of educational technology and beyond for teaching everyone to ‘code’. While Mozilla believes this to be important, it is only one part of a wider set of skills and competencies that are required to live and work on the web. In order to underpin Mozilla’s work, and to provide a map of the territory for others to use, we have worked with the community to create a <a href="https://webmaker.org/literacy">Web Literacy Map</a>:</p>

            <p class="text-center" id="weblitmap">
              <a href="https://webmaker.org/resources">
                <img src="assets/img/weblitmap-1.1.svg" onerror="this.src='assets/img/weblitmap-1.1.png'" alt="Mozilla Web Literacy Map competency grid" class="img-responsive">
              </a>
            </p>

            <p>The Web Literacy Map was created in consultation with a community of stakeholders from formal and informal education, as well as industry. The above images shows the competency grid. Under each competency there are a subset of skills that Mozilla and the community believe it is important to develop. For example, ‘Taking steps to secure non-encrypted connections’ sits as one of five skills that underpin the ‘Privacy’ competency.</p>
            <p>This is a <em>descriptive</em> rather than prescriptive map. That is to say people and organizations can align with it no matter what context they are working in - and no matter what level they are working at. The Web Literacy Map will evolve and mature along with the web itself, and in consultation with a growing community of stakeholders.</p>
            <p>One specific way in which Mozilla is using the Web Literacy Map is to inform our Webmaker project. This consists of the tools, resources and community necessary for mentors to teach the web.</p>

            <h2 id="webmaker">Mozilla Webmaker</h2>
            <p>Mozilla’s work is underpinned by a philosophy that we learn best through doing and making. While our thinking is influenced and informed by the works of academics in related fields, we’re interested in practical action. We're focused on helping people become more sophisticated in writing the web, participating in communities that explore web literacy and become advocates for the value and need for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web">open web</a>.</p>
            <p>Learning by making is not a new idea. This concept is fundamental to the work of foundational thinkers such as Froebel, Dewey, and Papert (amongst many others). For example, Froebel encouraged creative play using wooden blocks as a pedagogical tool; Dewey advocated for experiential learning; and Papert updated ideas around ‘hands-on’ learning for the computer age. Learning theories such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)">Constructivism</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism">Connectivism</a> influence our work around Webmaker and web literacy — along with, importantly, a sense of play.</p>
            <p>There are many communities that are interested in playful making as learning approaches, where learners don’t just consume, they produce. Maker culture is an extension of do-it-yourself (DIY) culture focused on the creative use of technology coupled with a strong ethos around grassroots invention and learning. Examples where making and production is common as a part of learning include the MIT’s Scratch game making community and Arduino enthusiasts who create with open source electronics prototyping hardware. Mozilla’s work is situated within this landscape of maker culture with an explicit commitment to the open web. Central to this is a culture of ‘tinkering’; the <a href="http://archive.makezine.com/04/ownyourown/">Maker Manifesto</a> states: “if you can’t open it, you don’t own it.” Many makers are amateurs — enthusiasts and hobbyists interested in the process as well as the product. An interest in building and supporting the open web is core to many Mozilla projects, including Webmaker.</p>
            <p>We understand ‘webmakers’ to be those participating in the culture of building the social and technical elements required for an open web. At the same time, we use ‘Webmaker’ to refer to the Mozilla website as well as the community that has mobilized in alignment with it. We recognize that there are also an array of webmaker practices which occur with and without Mozilla. Therefore, webmakers may complete various activities, including building content for the web through remix or coding, participating in discussions online, or teaching web literacy skills in their local communities. The profiles below are just a few examples of how some individuals use Webmaker and other resources in different contexts:</p>

            <h3 id="webmaker-tools">Webmaker Tools</h3>
            <p>Mozilla collaborates with many makers, mentors and educators around the world. The idea to create tools to encourage webmaking stems back to the first <a href="http://mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla Festival</a>, held in Barcelona in 2010. This event demonstrates many of the cultural and civic aspects of participating in building the open web. Since that first festival, Mozilla has continually iterated upon the ideas originated there to create a suite of Webmaker tools to help improve users’ web literacy skills. <a href="https://webmaker.org/">Webmaker.org</a> currently houses four tools: X-Ray Goggles, Thimble, Popcorn Maker, and Appmaker. More tools are proposed for the future. Each of these open source tools is used within a web browser and end-users can publish their completed projects to Mozilla servers. Because the tools are open source, community members can contribute to their development and ‘fork’ them for their own purposes if necessary.</p>

                  <a href="https://goggles.webmaker.org">goggles.webmaker.org</a>
                  <p>X-Ray Goggles (or Goggles) is a browser plug-in that allows an end-user to see the building blocks of the web. It shows the underlying HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) of the web page being visited. With Goggles, users can change the code and publish their version of the page. As an example, when Goggles is activated a user can change the headline of the site if it is contained in &quot;heading 1&quot; or an &quot; &lt;h1&gt;&quot; set of HTML tags. Popular X-Ray Goggles projects for new users include remixing the homepage of a newspaper or school.</p>

                  <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org">thimble.webmaker.org</a>
                  <p>Thimble is an HTML editor and preview pane, which displays in a single browser window. To the end-user, the code appears in the left pane, and the preview of the page of the rendered web page in the right. Thimble excels at allowing users to create a new webpage or alter a one page project. Popular Thimble projects at Webmaker for new users include remixing an internet meme, a magazine cover, or comic strip. Projects from Thimble can be published to Mozilla servers and shared.</p>

                  <h4>Popcorn Maker</h4>
                  <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org">popcorn.webmaker.org</a>
                  <p>Popcorn is a multimedia editor that works out of a browser window. Popcorn was created to be an HTML5 media framework, to demonstrate that the web is interoperable and media elements can be recombined. Within Popcorn, the user sees a timeline where they can add video clips, sound files, images, animated Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) files, Wikipedia pages, Google maps and more. These can be combined to remix and add commentary to existing media. Common first projects in Popcorn include a video to introduce oneself or to tell a story.</p>

                  <p>Appmaker is an easy-to-use mobile app creator. Based on burgeoning open web technology, Appmaker allows end-users to snap together mobile apps with lego-like bricks of functionality. Since the Appmaker ecosystem is built for the web, Appmaker apps work anywhere the web does — including the smartphone in your pocket!</p>

            <h3 id="webmaker-resources">Webmaker Resources</h3>
            <p>In addition to the tools, there are resources to assist those educators and mentors who wish to teach the web. These Open Educational Resources (OERs) include complete <a href="https://webmaker.org/teach">Teaching Kits</a> as well as more granular resources to make it easier to teach web literacy. The customizability and modularity of the OERs are their major value. The OERs are created in the open, so the audience has direct communication with the content creators and a direct influence on the content itself. The learning materials can be both customized and personalized to suit the expertise of individual mentors. The customizability and modularity of OERs are their major value. As one brief example, the <a href="https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/storycamp-resources">StoryCamp</a> kit (codesigned with <a href="http://www.bavc.org/">BAVC</a>) assists facilitators to empower youths wanting to tell their stories online. In the future, this kit could be remixed to empower young people to tell stories about collaboration, privacy or other web competency areas. Mozilla believes that the use of the Webmaker tools and teaching kits within an online training environment helps facilitate participatory cultures where there are “relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and sharing creations, and some type of informal mentorship” (Jenkins, et al., 2009, p. xi).</p>

            <h3 id="webmaker-community">Webmaker Community</h3>
            <p>In order to use our Webmaker tools and resources effectively to spread our goal of teaching the world the web, Mozilla has an active and growing community. Individuals often join because of an interest to learn something specific covered by the Web Literacy (such as ‘remix’) that they want to apply in their daily lives, workplaces or communities.</p>
            <p>Our community members seek to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>"level up</strong> their web literacy"</li>
              <li><strong>"build</strong> and <strong>share</strong> tools for teaching"</li>
              <li><strong>"gain</strong> peers and networks of practice"</li>
              <li><strong>"participate</strong> in coordinated actions"</li>
              <li><strong>"identify</strong> with a movement that's globally leveraged and locally contextualized" (Thorne, 2014)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In January 2013, Mozilla launched our first iteration of the Webmaker Community. We began testing strategies and programs to catalyze a global web literacy movement with local roots. Teaming up with existing initiatives such as the Hive Learning Network and the Maker Party campaign, we formed a ‘big tent’ initiative inviting organisations to be part of a global movement. Through Hive Learning Networks, stewarded by Mozilla in New York, Chicago and Toronto, organizations were already incubating transformative learning experiences for youth, by applying the principles of connected learning. At the same time, we have given individuals an opportunity to join the Webmaker Community and act as ‘context localizers’ for our tools and resources. We use multiple channels for this including social media (Facebook, Google+, Twitter) and a weekly community call.</p>
            <p>We also offer a training for new mentors who want to learn the theory and practice of teaching the web. Through a blend of online and offline training modules, we continue to test, co-design and support our global community to improve their skills and to connect with one another. We empower ‘Super Mentors’ from the Webmaker community to train new mentors looking to learn the theory and practice of teaching the web. We test new tools, prototypes and resources through the <a href="https://training.webmakerprototypes.org">training program</a>, as well as recognise contribution through <a href="https://webmaker.org/badges/webmaker-super-mentor">Webmaker badges</a>. The array of Webmaker community building approaches assist us in our attempts to spread and scale contributions to Mozilla.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Mozilla’s mission is to keep the Internet open, accessible and editable. We put users first and believe that empowering people to tell their own story online is of the utmost important. To that end, through our Webmaker project we provide the tools, resources, and community for people to teach and learn the web. Underpinning this is the Web Literacy Map, co-created with stakeholders and the community.</p>
            <p>There is no single, simple way to keep the web as the platform. That is why Mozilla - a global non-profit - is working towards using an array of strategies to build the open web with partners and the community.</p>
            <p>The webmaker movement is made up of people who teach the web to others over the kitchen table; people who use Webmaker tools in more informal learning settings like community centers or youth groups; people who use Mozilla resources as part of a curriculum in schools and colleges; people who join Mozilla’s community, participating in the creation of open source projects and teaching resources. People like you.</p>
            <p>Mozilla Webmaker is <em>your</em> project. Be part of it.</p>

            <h2 id="call-to-action">Call To Action</h2>
