#See the wiki
The [wiki associated with this Github repo](https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-curriculum/wiki) has tons of information about Clubs and links out to other plans and resources. Definitely give it a look! What we're currently working on can be found in the [Issues](https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-curriculum/issues) section.

#Remix this!

Create your own version of the curriculum by forking this repository:

1. Create a GitHub account and login
2. Hit the 'Fork' button to the top-right of this page
3. Edit the repository for your own needs

For the third step, you can edit each document in-situ on GitHub (easiest), or you can use the native client (slightly trickier, but better results). Either way, you'll need to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and/or HTML to format the pages. 

If you have changes to suggest to *this* repository, please fork it and then submit a pull request. Guidance on how to do this can be found in the [GitHub help section](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
