#Web Literacy Clubs curriculum (alpha)

##Meta


In 2015, Mozilla is working with the community on [Web Literacy Clubs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/2015/Mentors/Clubs) (name TBC). The idea is to address the following questions:

* **higher quality teaching and learning.** How can the teaching and learning experience be improved for mentors and learners?
* **local community networks.** How can local learning communities grow stronger and more networked through Webmaker?
* **contributor retention.** How can mentors be encouraged engage with Webmaker longer?

There will be a number of different kinds of clubs, all of which require initial guidance. The draft of a curriculum arc for clubs can be found below:

Introduction
-----

Teach the Web by helping your learners make, tinker, explore and play. Your goal is to give participants skills and exposure, experience and access to web making tools and knowledge. At the end of this curricular arc, learners will understand that they can be expressive on the web, and they will be armed with the tools and knowledge to build the web we all want. Learn more about the important concept of [Web Literacy](https://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/).

Special knowledge about the web is not required to run this in your club. The only thing your students need to be able to do is open a web browser that’s connected to the internet.
Module Instructions
Each Module has a series of units, designed to be completed in order. A unit includes 45 minutes of programming for your Webmaker Club. Modules also have an “Extension”, which details an optional unit for clubs that have more time to spend on a particular theme.

Once you’ve run through the units included in each module, your learners will have enough evidence to submit applications for achievements  included under “Learning Objectives and Assessment”. At the end of each module, remind your participants of the achievements they should apply for.

##Types of Webmaker Club


There are four types of Webmaker club. If you’re not affiliated with an organization, then yours is probably a ‘Community Club’.

###GLAM clubs

GLAM stands for “Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums”. These institutions generally have a bit of budget to run long-tail programming in an informal educational environment. The makeup of these programs depend on the institution, but generally audiences are first-come, first-serve and may include a large percentage of new learners at each session. 

###After School clubs
After School clubs are optional extended learning programming that take place directly after a school day. Formal educators prepare interest-based additional programming that students choose to participate in at the beginning of an academic year or semester. These programs likely attract the same group of learners over and over, so the club lead can prepare content that builds off the previous sessions learning objectives.

###Community clubs
A community club attracts audiences who are likely to be as interested in  social aspects of the club dynamic as  the learning objectives. These types of clubs attract a base of members sprinkled with regular new participants, so programming often needs to split the difference between repeat learners and new members. Mozillians might see this type of club as a regular community meetup that focuses on learning in addition to community organizing.

###University clubs
This kind of club tends to aim it’s programming to helping participants gain real world experience to extend the theoretical learning the university provides. Often these clubs are like After School clubs in that participants stick around for an academic year or semester. However this club can also provide the social aspect of a community club, so the type of programming determines the culture of the club.

#Choose your Persona

*Choosing a persona type reveals the agenda/kit for that type. Some modules might be the same, but we likely have enough resources to curate specific agendas for specific personas. Additionally, we can give certain personas more/less instruction.*

#Remix this!


Create your own version of the curriculum by forking this repository:

1. Create a GitHub account and login
2. Hit the 'Fork' button to the top-right of this page
3. Edit the repository for your own needs

For the third step, you can edit each document in-situ on GitHub (easiest), or you can use the native client (slightly trickier, but better results). Either way, you'll need to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and/or HTML to format the pages. 

If you have changes to suggest to *this* repository, please fork it and then submit a pull request. Guidance on how to do this can be found in the [GitHub help section](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
