            <h2>Ideally, the Club space offers both a large room where the group can meet as a whole, as well as "break-out" spaces, where smaller sets of participants can have discussions and collaborate. This resource has more tips and tricks on coordinating your club.

                                    <p>Libraries are community hubs, and librarians are usually enthused about having digital literacy events take place in their spaces.

                                    <p>Be sure you reserve a comfortable venue where you can move the chairs and sit together in a circle. Ensure there is Internet, power and good lighting. Nearby Hackerspaces are usually perfect for an event!</p>

                                    <p>Plan to tie in topics relevant to the museum, then speak with the museum director about your event. Ask the museum if they'll require an admission fee.</p>

						<h2><i class="fa fa-money"></i> Secure Funding</h2>
						<p>The best Clubs keep costs low by focusing on the essentials and tapping free and cheap resources. But it's still best to assess what it's going to cost to pull off your events.

                        <h2><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> Gather Materials</h2>
							<p>You'll want to double check that your space is available for your Club, and that your equipment and materials are available for when learners arrive. For group sessions and other brainstorming collaboration, here are some recommended supplies:

	                        <ul class="well blue">
		                        <li>Keep a stock of <strong>pens, post-its, markers, paper, craft supplies</strong> and anything else that will help your learners be creative.</li>
		                        <li>Make sure you have enough <strong>computers</strong> or that you have all the materials you need to #teachtheweb in low-fi and no-fi ways. If you don't have the means to provide computers, make sure participants know to bring their own and have an updated version of their browser installed.</li>
		                        <li>Arrange for <strong>snacks and drinks</strong>. All that cognitive collaborative work making will make people hungry and thirsty!</li>
		                        <li><strong>Name tags</strong> are an essential mechanism for participants to get to know one another. A few suggestions:
								<ul class="well">
								<li>Consider using a specific name tag format that has high impact: for pre-printed name tags, use only the first name, make it large on the name tag, then print the organizational affiliation in smaller type below it. This immediately makes things more human, giving participants a highly visible handle to use in introducing themselves to friends they have not yet met.</li>
								<li>Don't make different style name tags for participants and facilitators; a single name tag style without role labels breaks down barriers and enhances community energy.</li>
								<li>Go low budget! You can use a marker to write names on a piece of masking tape or grab a pack of printable labels to use as name tags.</li>
								</ul>
</li>
		                        <li>Make sure your materials reflect community norms while allowing kids the opportunity to express themselves.</li>
	                        </ul>
                        	</p>
                    </li>
                   
                    <li>
                    	<h2><i class="fa fa-wifi"></i> Run an IT Check</h2>
                    	<p>There's likely someone at the space that takes care of that building/office/restaurant's wifi/Internet. Find out who that person is, and talk to them about your Club. Make sure that the space will have a stable enough Internet connection for the number of participants expected. If you have to set up your own wifi and/or power, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/1346886">this awesome checklist</a> from David Wolever. Also see the <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/Festival2011-wifiports" target="_blank">Wifi port checklist from the Mozilla community</a>.
                    	</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h2><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Make a list of participants</h2></li>
                        <p>Personally invite as many <strong>learners</strong> as possible to your club and use your networks to get the word out. Remember to recruit a number of <strong>facilitators</strong> proportionate to the number of learners you anticipate attending club. We like a ratio of 1:8 or 1:12 facilitators to learners, but if people are engaged with the work - and you are super prepared - you can sometimes get away with something more like 1:20.</p>
