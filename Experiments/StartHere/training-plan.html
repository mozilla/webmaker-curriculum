          <h2>Before the Event</h2>
          <ol>
	          <li><strong>Find collaborators.</strong> Find people to work with who you find interesting. They can help you facilitate, promote, document and share your experience.</li>
	          <li>
	         	<p><strong>Create an list of people to invite.</strong> Teaching people who want to teach means finding people who want to teach! Create a list of people who might be interested.</p>
	         </li>
	         <li>
	         	<p><strong>Pick a date.</strong> Setting a date will push you to get your planning and preparation finished. How about 3 weeks from tomorrow?</p>
	         </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Find a space.</strong> Secure a comfortable area where you can sit together in a circle. For ideas on spaces, check out the <a href="starting-club.html">Starting a Club tip sheet</a>. Check if there is internet; <a href="https://keyboardkat.makes.org/thimble/LTIxMDA3NTY0ODA=/lofi-nofi-teaching-kit">although, you don't even need it to teach the web.</a>
              </p>
              <p>Choosing your date might be dependent on when your venue is available, so it's probably best to choose a date and a venue at about the same time.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
            	<p><strong>Determine your goals.</strong> Use broadstrokes in the beginning to figure out what you want to teach people during your training workshop. Later, you'll gather input from your potential learners, so just keep in mind the themes you want to cover.</p>
            </li>
			<li>
              <p><strong> Promote and Invite.</strong> If your training is an open, public event, think about your target participants. What are they interested in? How can you approach them? Make invitations tailored to their interests. </p>
              <p>You should consider writing a blog post as well as sending personalized emails to people you want to make sure are able to come. <a href="https://events.webmaker.org/#!/add">Add your event</a> to the Webmaker site and share your event across the web.
              </p>

              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Set up a method for feedback.</strong> Before your event, schedule a call with participants and ask them what they <em>want</em> to learn. Talk to them about what you want to teach, and think about how you can accomplish both sets of goals.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Craft an Agenda.</strong> Once you know what you want to teach and what your potential participants want to learn, begin crafting an agenda. Depending on your goals, there are <a href="https://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/host-a-training/">lots of excellent agendas</a> you can make your own at Webmaker Training. Below are more suggestions for crafting an agenda.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Have people register.</strong> Send a follow up email to people you've invited and ask them to RSVP for your event. You'll want to know exactly how many people are coming so you can make sure you have enough facilitators, mentors, food and so forth.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Gather materials.</strong> Gather paper, pens, computers, post-its, funny hats, markers and anything else you need, think about snacks and beverages and make sure you have all the things you need for a comfortable and informative training workshop.</p>
            <h2>During the Event</h2>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Welcome and warm up.</strong> Gather the group in a circle and invite them to introduce themselves. Maybe throw in  a fun game to warm up. Give your participants an overview of the day.
