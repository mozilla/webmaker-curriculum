                        <p>You know the power of the Web, that's why you're setting up a club to teach it! #MakeTheWeb to #TeachTheWeb. Here are some ideas to promote your club:</p>

                        <div class="well example">
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Set up a Site</strong> You will share your planning process and ideas widely. Create a page for your event. You can use webmaker.org (soon), wordpress.com, blogger.com, or tumblr.com to create a free page (free is good).</li>

                                <li><strong>Get Creative</strong> Show the world what you are up to with consistent posts to social media site including: Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube/ Vimeo and blogs. Get creative and make your own buzz in these spaces.</li>

                                <li><strong>Define a Hashtag</strong> Create a hashtag for the event. Throughout the event have participants and your crew tweet and post on social networks.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     <h2><i class="fa fa-file-text"></i> Craft a Press Release</h2> A press release is usually a one-page document describing your club, your organization and anything noteworthy that you might want to communicate. This document should be carefully written as reporters will refer to it when writing their stories. Remember to include clear contact information so that members of the media know who to follow up with. Here's an example: <img src="https://p2pu.org/media/uploads/images/LauraHilliger/2012/02/09/newsletter.png" style="float:none;">
                    </li>
					<li><h2><i class="fa fa-connectdevelop"></i> Network to Expand Your Contacts</h2>
	                Send out the news release at least a week before the event. Notify the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&src=hash">TeachTheWeb</a> community as well as mainstream media outlets in your  community —  newspapers, TV and radio — think about other outlets and  organizations  that potentially could spread the word about your club.  This might be parent groups, techie meet-ups, bloggers, podcasters, tweeters, etc. 
	                 <p><a href="http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs">Submit your URLs and social media links to the Community Discourse!</a></p>
	                </li>
                             
	                <li>
	                	<h2><i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i> Keep Spreading the Word about your Club</h2>
	                	<p>Plan to share the work you're doing in your club and host celebrations. Every so often, invite community members to join the club for a day or two, and build some Demo or Expo Fairs into your club's schedule. Keep a blog that documents the club's day-to-day work, as well as its special events. Invite kids to create dev blogs of their own. Be sure to protect time for championing your kids work at the club and in the community. <strong>Set dates and deadlines for sharing and meet them.</strong></p>
