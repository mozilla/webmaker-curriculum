                    <h1>Page Elements</h1><strong>Page Elements</strong> act as visual cues to guide the user through your content. You can use various page elements to draw attention to certain content and create a hierarchy within a page. Here are some of the various page elements you might want to use:

                    <p></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identification/Logo:</strong> communicates overarching goal (if done well)</li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fonts/Webfonts:</strong> typeface used to be a user-defined preference - using a typeface that wasn't default meant that the user might not have it on their computer. However, today we use a wide variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_typography#Web_fonts">webfonts</a>, which we style through <a href="https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/crash-course-html-and-css">CSS</a>.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Masthead/credits:</strong> can bring a human element to an otherwise business-oriented site</li>

                        <li><strong>Headlines:</strong> help create visual organization</li>

                        <li><strong>Subheads/subtitles:</strong> help create visual organization</li>

                        <li><strong>Pull-quotes, lead-ins and kickers:</strong> inspire deeper content dive</li>

                        <li><strong>Artwork/photographs:</strong> a picture is worth a thousand words.</li>

                        <li><strong>anchors/links:</strong> cross linking within the site, helpful jumping to content, keep users on the site</li>

                        <li>Breadcrumbs: so users know where they are</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Order your content and choose elements that underline your overarching goals.</p>

                    <h1>Interface design</h1>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Icons:</strong> can be used as visual guidance around a site. There are, arguably, several standard icons. For example, a trash can usually means delete, a folder is usually a collection of files) and so on.</li>

                        <li><strong>Logic versus reality:</strong> There are times when it is wise to use standard iconography or standard layouts, and times when either no standard exists or the existing standard is undesirable. In the end, the best thing to do is listen to your users. After all, they're who you're building for.</li>

                        <li><strong>Using metaphor:</strong> when designing for the web, you can think outside the box of common layouts and themes. You are free to design using metaphor or other creative perspectives because you can build anything you want.</li>

                        <li><strong>Grids as Guidance:</strong> In the West, we read from left to right. In design, try not to confuse the viewer by following a grid of some sort.</li>

                        <li><strong>Grid Design Methods:</strong> a fixed grid is one which stays at a certain width regardless of whether the user extends his or her browser window whereas a fluid grid extends and contracts when the user extends the window.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Typography</h1>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Designing for the Reader:</strong>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Reading with ease:</strong> shorter lines and a 1.5 line-height (also called "leading") are easier to read. Depending on the font, you might also want to increase or decrease kerning, the space between letters.</li>

                                <li><strong>Webfonts:</strong> the most extensive open webfont library is at fonts.google.com. Simply choose a font, click the "Quick Use" button and copy and paste the fonts URL into the &lt;head&gt; tag.</li>

                                <li><strong>Columns as Control:</strong> use columns to help keep large blocks of text easily readable. It's easier for a user to scroll up and down than left to right.</li>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>The blech factor:</strong> Basically, the idea with type is to make it easier to read, not harder.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>CAPITALIZATION:</strong> ALL CAPS IN LARGE BODIES OF TEXT ARE HARD TO READ</li>

                                        <li><strong>Centering:</strong> large blocks of centered text are also difficult to read.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Cascading Style Sheets:</strong> Because there are multiple ways to assign CSS styles to elements, styles can "stack" on top of one another. For example, if you set a global style for a &lt;p&gt; tag, then assign a particular instance of that tag with a class, defined in the styles section of your page, and then place an inline style in the tag itself, the element will apply the global style, then the class style, then the inline style. This is what is meant by "cascading"</li>

                        <li><strong>Graphics as text</strong> With the popularity of webfonts, there's really no reason to create images of text. Doing so makes the text less accessible – screen readers will only read the graphical text if you've included the "alt" attribute, and users will not be able to copy and paste.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Color</h1>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>hexidecimals</strong> is a six digit number that represents colors. In CSS it begins with a # followed by a combination of numbers and letters that represent a color. The first two characters represent red, the next two green, and the final two characters represent the blues in the color. #FF0000 is red, #00FF00 is green and #0000FF is blue. #FFFFFF is white and #000000 is black.</li>

                        <li><strong>Color Association</strong> – shared understandings:http://www.sensationalcolor.com/color-meaning-symbolism-and-psychology/</li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Color Terms</strong>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Hue:</strong> the color part of a color, such as red or blue.</li>

                                <li><strong>Saturation:</strong> the intensity of that color</li>

                                <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> the amount of lightness or darkness in a color</li>

                                <li><strong>Neutral Colors:</strong> Black, white, or gray; also known as non-chromatic hues.</li>

                                <li><strong>Chromatic Hues:</strong> not black, white or gray.</li>

                                <li><strong>Monochromatic Color:</strong> Color combinations using tints and shades of a single hue.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <h1>Consistency</h1>

                    <p>Consistency is creating and following rules (and exceptions to these rules), using restraint in design and standard placement for repeating elements (such as navigation). Creating consistency leads to a better user experience.</p>
