                    <h2>Determining Motivation</h2>

                    <p>Designing for the web is an evolutionary design process. As technology evolves, you'll update and change content and structure to make your webpage better. It's important to have a plan when designing for the web. This plan will help you work efficiently and allow you to reach the people you're trying to reach. What do you want to accomplish with your website? Determining your motivation will help you plan with purpose.</p><strong>Do you want to:</strong>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Tell a story</li>

                        <li>sell something</li>

                        <li>make friends</li>

                        <li>teach skills</li>

                        <li>show pictures</li>

                        <li>present your portfolio</li>

                        <li>something else entirely?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Defining Audience</h2>

                    <h3>Ask yourself</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How old are these people?</li>

                        <li>Do they have a lot of family obligations?</li>

                        <li>Do they have a particular career path?</li>

                        <li>How often are they online?</li>

                        <li>What are their hobbies?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Age range:</strong> Could impact color scheme, text size, and language used.</li>

                        <li><strong>Level of computer experience:</strong> Impacts viewer’s ability to interact with the site. What are they used to in terms of site design?</li>

                        <li><strong>Hobbies/Interests/Pastimes:</strong> May help to gear and guide the taste of the site as well as point views to other resources within these interests that they enjoy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Designing for your Audience</h2>

                    <p>You need to know who your target audience is. A target audience is a group of people that have something in common, and it greatly influences many design aspects.</p>

                    <p>Think about the type of people you want to engage. Make notes about things like age, family status, computer experience and interests or hobbies. </p>

                    <p>The <strong>target audience</strong> is important because it helps to answer a bunch of design questions you’re going to have.</p>

                    <h2>Content</h2>

                    <p>Write all the content bits and pieces out on little pieces of paper. Then, categorize the pieces. This exercise will give you a logical global navigation (and sub-navigation if you have lots of content).</p>

                    <p>There’s no one way to organize content. You need to have a feel for what your content is, and then categorize pieces together. Don’t forget, it’s easier to rearrange pieces of paper than electronic data.</p>

                    <p>This process doesn’t just help the organization of content, it also helps you begin to think about production resources you will need and a time plan.</p>

                            <h2>Navigation</h2>

                            <p>If you’ve worked through the content section, you’ll know that Navigation relies quite heavily on the content. Organizing content will reveal logical global and sub navigation. What comes first? Create a hierarchy for your content.</p>

                            <p>The site map shows exactly how many navigational items you’ll need as well as the hierarchy of the pages. The creation of a site map will also help you eliminate irrelevant content and know what you need to produce. It’s a good idea to take your time with this because without it, it will quickly become confusing where a particular piece of content “lives”. A simple and clear navigation structure is important so that your users don’t get confused or frustrated.</p>
