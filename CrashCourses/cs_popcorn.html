  <h1>Popcorn's Basic Features</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h5>Projects</h5>
         <p>A project provides a visual layout and is usually designed for a specific kind of content. Clicking the +Events Button at the
            top right of the interface, allows you
            to see all the plug-ins you can use in your project. You
            have to drag the plug-in you’d like to use and drop it onto the canvas or into the timeline
            to add it to your project.</p>
          <p>You will see the project gallery at <a href="http://popcorn.webmaker.org">popcorn.webmaker.org</a>.
            You can also create a project <a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/templates/basic/">from scratch</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Events</h5>
      <p> An event is a marker that says “do something” at a specific point in your
            film. To add an event to the timeline, you drag and drop the text from
            the Events box to the Timeline! To delete an event from the Timeline,
            you click the event and hit the Delete key on your keyboard.</p>
          <p> Popcorn has a great many plug-ins which allow you to pull events into your
            timeline. Because there are many plug-ins and projects to remix, there are infinite
            variations and possibilities. No two Popcorn projects will be the same. But
            the authoring pattern is always the same: <strong>choose a plug-in, add it to the
            timeline, and configure the event.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Layers</h5>
      <p> A Popcorn Maker project can have an infinite number of layers. Layers help you,
            the creator, organize events in the way that seems most logical to you.
            Maybe you want one layer to visualize all the Twitter events. Or maybe you
            want one layer to visualize all the cat-related events. It’s up to you.
            When you mouse over the name of a layer, you’ll see a trashcan to the right. This allows you to delete the
            layer.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="right">
      <h5>Saving, Exporting and Publishing</h5>
      <p> You can save your project, export the code of your project and/or publish
            your project to the WWW. To save, you'll need to create a Persona account. Just follow the on screen instructions
            and share your masterpieces with the world! </p>

    <h1>Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>
      <p><img src="static/espace.png" alt="space" height="44"><strong>Spacebar</strong> allows you to Play and
              Pause the video playback. Using this
              shortcut will also update the timeline
              view if the playhead gets lost.</p>
            <p><img src="static/left.png" alt="left arrow" width="64" height="64"><img src="static/right.png" alt="right arrow" width="64" height="64"> If you click an event and hold down <strong>SHIFT</strong>, then click another event, you
              can move both events on the timeline
              in sync using the <strong>arrow keys.</strong></p>
            <p> <img src="static/up.png" alt="up arrow" width="64" height="64"><img src="static/down.png" alt="down arrow" width="64" height="64">Using the <strong>up/down arrow keys</strong> will allow
              you to move an event to a different track.</p>
            <p> <img src="static/delete.png" alt="r" width="64" height="64">Click on an event and hit the <strong>delete</strong> key to remove it from the timeline.</p>  </div>
