Welcome to the Webmaker Activity Template!

Use this template to create activities and resources for your goals. Use a new template for each activity. Haven't thought about your goals? Try this template: 

This page requires a unique blend of HTML agility, CSS wizardry and mental firepower. There are people who are on the web, and then there are people who MAKE the web. Your goal in this project is to MAKE your very own Webmaker activity page. Add images, links and content to this page to create your very own activity page and help others teach the web.
============================================================================ --><!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

Now list a few things that you want to include in your cheet sheet. The <ul> tag is used for bulleted, or unordered lists (versus <ol> for ordered lists). Each <li> tag is a separate list item, or bullet. You can change the text between each <li> tag. You can even try making this an ordered list (Hint: <ol> instead of <ul> and remember to close the tag!)

You can also link out to projects you've done or sites you love by using the <a> tag which is used for hyperlinks. The <a> tag has a very important attribute: href, which defines the URL you want to point to. The text you put between the open <a> tag and the close </a> tag will hyperlink the text that shows up on the page, linking to the URL you specify. Try it out!

You can change your tagline by changing the text within the <h1> tag. <h1> is used for headings - the "h" stands for header and the "1" stands for most important (versus h2, h3, etc.). Try a different headline for your avatar.

  <h2> Icebreaker Activity: Who defines the whole child?</h2>
  <h3><span class="title">Target Audience: Educators </span></h3>
  <p><em>This is a quick icebreaker activity for educators who are hesitant to include technology or #teachtheweb activities into the classroom. This activity could be used as a lead in to other hacking activities planned for the day. <br>Tapping into the importance of teaching the whole, participants will explore the disconnect between the reality of the whole child and their perceptions of the whole child. </em></p>

      <ul>
        <li>If we ignore elements of the child (such as their interest in technology), are we really using the whole child approach?</li>
        <li>Is it ok for educators to decide what does and does not count as "legitimate interests" of the child?</li>
        <li>What risks are we running by selecting the parts of the child we want to teach?</li>

Congrats on completing your activity! You can still go back and change things - that's the beauty of the Web. You might have missed it, but you actually learned some stuff in this project. You now know how to do comments in HTML and CSS, manipulate some CSS, work with headers (the <h1> tag), use lists (<ul> and <ol>) and bullets (<li>), add hyperlinks to text (<a> tag) and even a little about open educational resources. Way to go, Webmaker!
