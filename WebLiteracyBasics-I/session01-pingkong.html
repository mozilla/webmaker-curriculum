                                <p>When the student returns, ask if anyone knows how the devices at each hop know exactly where to send a packet. If no one knows, explain:</p>

                        <h3>Off to the races!</h3>

                        <p>Now it's time for everyone to try the obstacle course!</p>

                        <p><b>Explain to the students that they are all “packets”</b> trying to make their way to Google.com (or the website you chose) to complete someone’s Internet request. They must stop at each “hop” before moving on to the next one.</p>

                        <p><strong>But wait, there's a twist!</strong> Before the packets can get from one hop to the next, they must complete a quick challenge posed by the student acting as the Hop. <em>Examples: Do 5 jumping jacks! Sing “Happy Birthday” etc.</em></p><img class="img-example" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8233430386_45a5aba09a_b.jpg">

                        <p>When the packet completes the Hop's challenge, the Hop will allow the packet to move the next location until the packets reach "The Website".</p>

                        <p>Ask the packets to form a single-file line and move through the obstacle course as quick as they can! You can have someone time how long it takes everyone to get through the course to see who makes it the fastest.</p><img class="img-example" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8207/8233430120_ea0c7fc7fa_b.jpg"></div>

                            <h3>Reflection</h3>

                            <p>After all learners have completed the obstacle course, show them just how quickly packets are able to move through the the Internet in real life.</p>

                            <p><em>If you don't have internet connectivity or are short on time, skip the Ping Utility exercise.</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Ask the group some reflective questions like:</strong></p>

                            <div class="well example">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How long did it take you to get all the way from the computer through the Internet to the website?</li>
									<li>Do you think a computer moves faster through the Internet than you did?</li>
                                    <li>What happens on the Internet when you type a Web address and hit enter?</li>
									<li>What are the 'parts' of the Internet?</li>
									<li>How do large amounts of information ever make it through low-bandwidth parts of the Net?</li>
									<li>What's the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web? </li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                            <p>Take a few guesses and then explain that we can actually tell exactly how long a real request takes by using the Ping utility in the Command Prompt (PC) or Terminal (Mac). Or if you are offline, just explain what would happen.</p>

                            <div class="well example">
                                <em>Ping is a function on computers that lets you check to see if your computer can connect to another computer over the network or online by sending a ‘packet’ of data to it and seeing how long it takes for the packet to come back.</em>

                            <p>Ask students to make specific guesses/bets for how long it will take for 5 packets to ping Google and come back. Write down their guesses on the wall.</p>

                            <p>Either in groups (if equipment is available) or as one group looking at the projector, run the ping utility on google.com (use the tip sheet for instructions!)</p>

                            <p>Discuss the results</p>
