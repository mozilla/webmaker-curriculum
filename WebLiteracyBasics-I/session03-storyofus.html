                            <p>
                                Introduce the session by explaining that stories are a powerful way to not only share your experience with others, but to also better understand the experience yourself. Explain that we will use some storytelling technqiues to share our own journey and perspective, as well as reflect together as a group about where we want to go from here. 
                            </p>

                                    Introduce what makes a good Story of Self. It has three parts:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Me.</b> Start your story with who you are. This enables your audience to understand your perspective and grounds your story in your voice and experience. Focus on an aspect of your life where you faced a challenge and made a choice. For example, why did you decide to come to this group?</li>
                                    <li><b>Us.</b>b> An effective story bridges your personal perspective with your audiences. In this part, explain why your story is relevant to your audience. What challenges and choices await them? For example, as a group, what obstacles will face you after today, and what choices do you have in response? Will you continue to meet and learn together? What will that look like? </li>
                                    <li><b>Now.</b> You want your audience to leave feeling like they can take action, and that they know what that action is. Present your idea of what the opportunity for now is. For example, do you think the group should continue meeting every month? Do you want to stay in touch online? Give concrete steps of what can be done next. </li>
                                </ul>

                            <h3>Tell your Story of Self</h3>
                            
                            <p>
                                 Using the Story of Self structure and Radio Rookie guidelines, invite learners to develop their own narratives in small groups. Give each group a few minutes to first brainstorm on their own, and then to tell their story to their small group. Encourage them to think about what they've learned in the group so far, which may provide good examples and resources to include in the story. Allot 2-3 minutes per storyteller.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                 Ask the emmebers of the groups to give each other feedback. What was compelling about the stories? Where there any important details or context missing? How could the story be improved for the next telling? 
                            </p>

                                 Now start recording! Using the recording function on your mobile phones or laptops, take turns recording each others stories. Consider what web services are most appropriate here. SoundCloud and YouTube allow you to post and license your content easily, but you may also have your favorites. Dropbox is also a good option for storing and organizing recordings.
                            </p>

                                 Have learners share the links to your groups' selected service. Explain that each of our individual stories is also telling a larger story: the story of us, of our group.

                                 As a group, reflect on your stories. What was the process like? What did they learn about each other? How would they like to stay in touch and participate with one another, keeping in mind both synchronous and asynchronous discussion options?
