                            <h3>Teaching in Pairs</h3>

                            <p>
                                Begin the session by explaining that everyone has something to learn and to teach. We all know things that may help others, and <b>one of the values of the open web is that it's easy to share this knowledge with others.</b> In fact, this approach of "sharing what we know" has been part of the web since it was invented.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Have learners team up into pairs. Invite the learners to think briefly about <b>a simple skill they can share with their partner.</b> Some examples include: a new dance, a more efficient way to tie your shoe, or how to say something in another language. Remind them to give clear instructions and think about effective ways of sharing their skill.   
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                For five minutes have the first partner teach their skill to their partner. Then switch. After both partners have gone, gather back as a large group and ask a few pairs to briefly explain what their partner taught them. Encourage them to reflect on what made instructions easy to understand and memorable. 
                            </p>

                        </div>
                    </li>

                            </div>

			<!-- ADD DETAILS OF YOUR MAIN ACTIVITY -->

                            <h3>Make a recipe</h3>

                            <p>
                                <b>Talk about how good instructions are like recipes in a cookbook.</b> Chefs write recipes to share with other chefs and also as reminders to themselves about how to do something. Explain that now we'll make recipes that help others learn the skills we just taught each other.  
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                In the same pairs, invite your learners to write a brief summary of the steps required to learn their skill. Encourage the pairs to review each others' recipes and to give constructive feedback to make the recipes easy for others to understand. Now explain that since we want our knowledge to be as wide-spread as possible, we'll use openly licensed content that allows others to access and modify our recipes without needing to ask us for permission.  
                            </p>                            
                            
                            <p>
                                Building on the <a href="session01-kraken.html">Kraken the Code</a> and <a href="session02-hackthenews.html">Hack the News</a> activities, invite the pairs to <b>search the web to find openly licensed resources</b> that would illustrate their recipes. Have them consider what resources will be appropriate, and whether the license will allow them to remix it. Reminder learners that on the web, recipes are often more than just text: they can use videoes, animated gifs, audio guides and many other kinds of digital resources.  
                            </p>
                            
                            <div class="well example">
                                <p>
                                    To easily find openly licensed resources, try using these services: 
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Creative Commons search tool</li>
                                    <li>Google advanced settings</li>
                                    <li>Wikipedia</li>
                                    <li>Flickr</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Your learners can also make their own resources. Think about taking photos, making a quick video or writing a new text as part of the recipe. Bonus if your learners create these resources on their mobile phones, using services like Instagram, SoundCloud and YouTube to make something they can post to the web and easily add an open license to.  
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Have the pairs sequence their ingredients and the recipe's steps, and if needed, make any adjustments. For simple editing of web pages, try the <a href="https://webmaker.org/goggles">X-Ray Goggles.</a> If you have low-connectivity, just use pen and paper to write your recipe and show what additional resources would be added. 
                            </p>
                            
                            
                    </li>

                    <li style="border-bottom:none;">
                        <div>
                            <div class="time">

                            <h3>Web Chef Cooking Show/h3>
                            
                            <p>
                                Gather all the recipes and everyone back into a big group. Now all the Web Chefs are ready for a cooking show. Two pairs of chefs are assigned a recipe from another group. The two pairs race each other to see who can successfully follow the recipe fastest. Make it more challenging by having pairs complete the recipe blindfolded, or while hopping on one leg, etc.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                After a few rounds, reflect on what made good recipes. What other information would help? Did anyone modify a recipe as they did it? If so, why and how could you share that modification with other chefs? 
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
