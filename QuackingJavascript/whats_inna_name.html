              Javascript is one of the key parts of the Web (together with HTML and CSS). Without it pages would be
              pretty static as JS creates interactivity. We can say that Javascript helps make the web dance.

                <p>
                  If, you are working thought these activities on your own then you can try each of them in turn and skip the ones you can't do by yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If, you are going to do a workshop with other people then it's a good idea to first <b>do the activities on your own</b> to become familiar with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of these activites use the online Thimble tool from Mozilla webmaker. To get the most out of the workshop it is a good idea to get
                  your students to head over to <a href="https://webmaker.org"> "https://webmaker.org</a> and create a Webmaker account if they don't already have one.
                  In this way they will be able to save work.

                      <li>
                        Write your name on a piece of paper and Close the boxes.

                      <li>
                        Open the boxes and stand next to your box. The person you are standing with will be your coding partner for this session.

                  In this game the boxes represent variables and the sheets of paper with our names on are values. Variables are used all the time in coding to work
                  with different kinds of data.

                <p>
                  In the Magic Numbers session we found out about different Datatypes including numbers and Strings. This activity is like creating lots of different variables
                  of with String values. The string value are our names.

                <h3>Activity - Create an online, international T-Shirt Shop</h3>

                <p>
                  Variables are a way of storing data in coding. This activity uses number variables to do the maths needed to create an international T-Shirt shop.

                </p>

                <p>
                  Everyone loves T-shirts and with international shipping you can get rare T-shirts from around the world. The problem is currency rates between different kinds of money are always going up and down. 
                </p>

                  What we just did in the language of coding was to assign (give) a value of "Derek the Duck" to a new varible called my name. Next try this:

                <h4> What did this teach us about Javascript and variables? </h4>
                <p>

                  These lines of code create and then print out a variable. A variable is a way of storing a number, name or some other information. 
                  You can think of it as a space in the memory of computer or phone. When you save a number in your phone, it is being kept as a variable.
                  Let's look at our lines of code.
                </p>

                <p>
                  &nbsp;
                </p>
                <div class="well example">
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In <b>a</b> We asked to be shown the value of the “variable” called myName. There was an undefined error - don't worry about that - 
                      it's because we haven’t created a variable called myName yet.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      In <b>b</b> we do create a variable of myName and give it a value. In my example this is like the instruction “Set the variable myName to be a value of Derek the Duck ”.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In <b>c</b> we can see that this has worked. We Type the name of the variable and the value appears on the Console.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                  Generating ideas for fun names. </b>

                <div class="well example">
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Get 3 or 4 boxes to hold your ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Get lots of post it notes or bits of paper.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Decide on categories for your boxes: eg, colours, moods, animals, food.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                  Choose 2 boxes. Let's say colour and food. Everyone go around and think of one each. Examples could be, Red Lion, Blue Cat, Green Cow etc. No-one can
                  choose the same animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Try this again with 2 other boxes. Keep going and try to get crazier and stranger combinations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now everyone has to write on post it notes of bits of paper to put in at least one in each box. They should write their own choices.

                <h3>Remixing a page: Custard Pies Tour</h3>

                <p>
                  Katy Perry is going on tour again soon. But there is a problem! Katy has not chosen the name of the tour yet. She has many many of ideas and just can't decide yet. It is going to be either “Changeable Custard”, “Fickle Flans” or “Variable Vollyballs” .
                </p>

                <p>
                  Our team has written a web page using Javascript to make it easy to change the name of the tour. Our job is to update the page with the correct name.
                </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Go to <a href = "https://thimbleprojects.org/mickfuzz/82301">the Tour Promotion page -  here </a> 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      click REMIX (green button on the top right)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You can see the code of the page on the left window and the end result on the right.
                      Don’t worry you don’t need to understand all the code we are just changing one thing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Find where the value of the variable tourName is set (clue it’s near the top) & Change the value of this variable from Custard Pies to something else
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You will see all mentions of the tour on the page on the right get updated.
                      How many mentions of your tour name are there on the right?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Look at the code. Can you find the code used to <strong>write the value of the variable tourName into the document</strong>?

                    <li>
                      To check can you find two mentions of tourName in the code and see where they appear in the web page on the right?
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                </div>
                <p>
                  <strong>Answer: </strong>The code used to write our variable to the page is

                </p>

                &lt;script&gt;
                <br/>
                document.write(tourName)
                <br/>
                &lt;/script&gt;
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p>
                  <strong>Bonus Question: </strong>All javascript needs to go inside &lt;script&gt; tags in an HTML page. What happens if you remove the &lt;script&gt; tags
                </p>

                    <li>
                      Can you remix the page much more to change it much more. Change the name of the artist. Can you change the photos and logos used? What about the text of the page.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      What about variables in javascript? This example showed us the power of variables. If we change the value of a variable in one place then every time it is used the new value will be used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Can you think of a website you might want to make. Can you imagine a page on this website where you could use a variable to give you the ability to change something in one place, and for all mentions of it to be updated everywhere in all your pages of the site. Can you think of examples of how this is used in other real life websites?
