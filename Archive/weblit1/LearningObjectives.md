##Web Literacy Basics I
In this module, learners begin to find out about the foundations of the web. Discovering what makes the web a unique place to find and gather information, they'll learn about how the web is constructed. 

##Big Ideas
The web is like lego, so you can remix it's building blocks to make your first web page. You can use technology to search for, organize and use resources to be expressive creatively. When using other people's media, you should attribute their contribution to your work, ideas or projects.

#Tools
* the Browser
* [X-Ray Goggles](http://goggles.webmaker.org)

##Learning Objectives and Assessment

By the end of this module, learners should be able to: 

* Install X-Ray Goggles as a bookmarklet
* Search for an image and discover its URL for including in a remixed web page
* Use X-Ray Goggles to modify text and images on specific web pages
* Switch between browser tabs
* Make use of keyboard shortcuts (i.e. for copying and pasting) 
* Use X-Ray Goggles to modify text and images on any web page
* Attribute images, text and other assets used from other websites
* Choose openly-licensed assets to include in a web page 
* Publish a remixed web page and make a note of its URL
* Discover time-sensitive information using a range of search engines
* Identifying openly-licensed images relating to a specific event
* Assess the credibility of websites and their content by comparing information from a number of sources
