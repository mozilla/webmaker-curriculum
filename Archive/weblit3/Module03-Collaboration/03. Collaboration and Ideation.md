#Module 3: Collaborating and Ideation (3 units)

Help learners get to know each other's interests and look for ways to mash up ideas and inspirations to establish a concept that can be followed to production. At the end of this module, learners have a partner/group and a rough idea of what they want to build with the Web.


##Learning Objectives and Assessment

By the end of this module, learners should be able to: 

* use synchronous and asynchronous tools to communicate with web communities, networks and groups (particularly their project group)
* choose web tools for particular contributions/collaborations
* use and share files in open, web-friendly formats
* share processes and ideas in an open, online format (e.g. blogging or microblogging)

Learners should also be aware that:

* collaboration makes ideation more fun and successful
* decision trees are useful to apply logic to problems, and can be used to make interactive stories
* conditionals lead a user to make decisions based on the conditions of a story arc
* IF/THEN statements are statements that return a value
* working together will help develop ideas

* **Sharing:** Creating web resources with others
* **Collaborating:** Providing access to web resources
* **Open Practices:** Helping to keep the web democratic and universally accessible

**Assessing the learning**

At the end of this module, learners should have begun using synchronous and asynchronous tools to communicate with web communities, networks and groups, particularly their project group. They should be choosing web tools to use with their groups for particular contributions/collaborations, and begin using and sharing files in open, web-friendly formats. Additionally, learners will share processes and ideas in an open, online format (e.g. blogging or microblogging).

##Agendas


**Unit 7: Form Project groups (45 mins)** *This unit uses mindmapping to get learners to articulate their initial ideas, which the facilitator can use to create project groups.*

<ol>
<li>(5 mins) <strong>Introduction round</strong> (always say hello first!)</li>
<li>(25 mins) Defining the problem, Collaborative Mindmapping: Facilitators ask club participants what they want to build and why. <a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/LTExNjY1MTUy/collaborative-mindmapping-defining-the-problem">Participants use mindmapping to focus on the why</a>.</li>
<li>(5 mins) <strong>Sort Yourselves Icebreaker</strong> Facilitators should run <a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/sort-yourselves-icebreaker">this activity</a> to allow for distributed skillsets</li>
<li>(10 mins) <strong>Group Talk</strong> Form groups and have each group discuss their mindmaps and initial ideas</li>
</ol>

**Unit 8: Brainstorming (45 mins)** *This unit has learners working together to brainstorm around web projects they would like to build.*

<ol>
<li>(5 mins) <strong>Introduction round</strong> (always say hello first!)</li>
<li>(20 mins) <strong>Firestarter:</strong> Groups work together to <a href="https://jess.makes.org/thimble/LTE2OTY1MzA0MzI=/firestarter">define design opportunities for the next several club meetups</a> (e.g. what do they want their web project to be)</li>
<li>(20 mins) <strong>Collaborative tool demos:</strong> Facilitators introduce club members to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/Teach/LiteracyResources/Introduction_to_Collaborative_Tools">different tools their groups can use</a> during the club./</li>
</ol>


**Unit 9: Forming Connections (45 mins)** *This unit sets up shared repositories and resources so that club members can access their work during and outside of the club.*

<ol>
<li>(5 mins) <strong>Introduction round</strong> Welcome new club members and remind old club mentors of the club rules.</li>
<li>(40 mins) <strong>Process Decisions:</strong> Facilitators have learners create or link social identities, set up online workspaces (e.g. blogs and collaborative documents), and create (or learn to use) club specific tools. Learners should have this for their individual groups, and learn how to use club wide resources.</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Openly:</strong> Facilitator explains that club members will work openly and share their progress via blogs and social media. Facilitators help learners set up IRC and connect to (#TeachTheWeb on the Mozilla servers)[http://discourse.webmaker.org/t/how-does-one-connect-to-this-irc-thing/292].</li>
<li><strong>Shared Resources:</strong> Clubs set up shared repositories and identities</li>
</ul>
</ol>

##Extension

The extension for Module 3 helps learners reflect on why connection is an important part of webmaking.
