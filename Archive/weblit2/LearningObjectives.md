#Web Literacy Basics II (3 sessions)

This module uses pre-existing webpages to help learners use remixing to make something new. It teaches basic HTML/CSS while helping learners understand that the web was built for remixing. This module also helps learners put their ideas online by focusing on the basic technologies that make the Web run (HTML/CSS). 

If your club has done ideation or planning modules, you can use participants pre-existing content to help them build their ideas for the web. Otherwise, use the activities to help learners understand the basic concepts of composing for the web, HTML and CSS.
