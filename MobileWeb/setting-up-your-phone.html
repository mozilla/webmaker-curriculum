                            <h3>Preparation</h3>
                            <p>When you first receive a phone, not all of the apps you might want or need (like WhatsApp or Facebook) will be on your phone. This is why we need to first connect to the Internet in order to install them, and set them up from there &mdash; only then are we ready to use them.</p>

                            <p>This section will explore how we can get apps, programs and activities on our mobile phone, and different parts of the set-up process.  By the end of this session, the participants will be confident about what is needed to install an app, and will have each set up a Webmaker account.</p>

                            <br />

                            <h4>What is Webmaker?</h4>
                            <p>Most people just use the Internet to consume information, but what if you could help shape the Internet itself, by contributing content that is important to you and your community?</p>

                            <p>Webmaker is a tool built by Mozilla, to enable you to create projects or webpages on the Internet. Through the app on your android smartphone, you can design projects on the Internet with text, photos and other links. These lessons about the webmaker app will give you the skills you need to be an active participant in the Internet.</p>

                            <h3>Icebreaker: Stand up, sit down</h3>

                            <p>This game is a process of elimination, where the winner is the last one (or last few) standing.</p>

                            <p>Start this game with everyone standing up. After asking the group a question, learners sit down if they don't fit the question's criteria. They stay sitting down unless they can answer affirmatively to a "<b>stand up</b>" question.</p>

                            <p>Start with a test question, like, "Sit down if you were born in Bangladesh". The majority of people will sit down here, so then get everyone to stand up again, and start the game properly.</p>

                                <p>These are some sample questions, but feel free to adapt them, or add to them as you go.</p>

                            <p><em>This activity is designed for people who have never installed an app. If your learners are familiar with installing apps from Google Play, you can skip to <a href="#set-up-webmaker">Activity 4</a>.</em></p>

                            <p>Explore these words in your group. Are you familiar with them?</p>

                            <p>The meanings of all of these words and phrases are in the glossary (see page 4 of <a href="../assets/webmaker-mobile-curriculum-handout.pdf">the handbook</a>), but there may be more contextually relevant ways to explain these concepts to your learners. Feel free to add narrative to your explanations to make them clearer to the class. The glossary includes definitions for all of the below terms.</p>

                            <h3>Setting up Webmaker</h3>

                            <p>Ideally, participants will work alone here, but this will depend on the number of android phones you have available. Please use the below guidelines, depending on the phone/ person ratio.</p>

                            <p><b>One phone per participant:</b>  Each participant works individually to go through the set-up/ installation process on their phone, creating a webmaker account on their smartphone.</p>

                            <p><b>One phone per 2/3 participants:</b> Participants work in small groups of 2-3 people, setting-up/ installing the app together, alternating the person performing each step, so everyone is involved. This option is also useful where technical confidence/ competence is low amongst the participants.</p>

                            <p><b>One phone in the group:</b> Depending on the size of the group (if larger than 8 people, you might want to have everyone watch/take turns in the installation process, and then divide the group in half again and  give people the opportunity to create email addresses/logins and login for themselves with the one app.  Alternatively, you could have one person (a participant or a mentor) performing each action while others explain how/what to do.</p>

                            <br />

                            <p>Build an account for yourself or your group reviewing the steps above, recreate the process on your smartphone.</p>

                                <p><b>Why do I need an email address?</b> When you register with your email address, it means that Webmaker can get in touch with you to confirm that you want to create an account, and help you reset your password in case you forget it. Also, when it comes to sharing things that you create or discover on the internet, an email address is an important piece of the puzzle!</p>

                            <p>With each individual from the group, pull out two words/phrases from the eight steps, and ask the participant to explain them, ensuring they have a reasonable grasp of the process.</p>

                            <p>Additionally, closely observe as the group builds accounts for themselves, watching for any uncertain/ problem areas. If there is a particular area which proved difficult for several members, it would be good to run through that step in greater detail.</p>
